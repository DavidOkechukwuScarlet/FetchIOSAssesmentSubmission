### Steps to Run the App

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

One specific area of the project that I prioritized was on making clean code as this was said to be aimed at a level similar to production ready code. I chose to focus on this area because I know how important it is in a database to make code that can be easily understood and improved upon by other members of the team.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

I took around 4.5 hours to work on this project, I spent the majority of my time planning out the design and building out the architecture/networking/testing with the rest of the time spent on building an interactive UI that makes it easy for users to find recipes and cuisines

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

One, significant trade-offs I made in my approach could be opting for UI elements that are more aligned with the Caching approach for the images. For example, utilizing lists instead of scrollviews which allow for lazy loading I thought would be more in line with bandwidth limitations as opposed to creating my own approach that would load with bandwidth in mind or opting for a scrollview which would give me more control over the layout. 

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

I think that the weakest part of my project is probably the UI, I think that although my UI is clean and simple, I could have spent more time making it more interactive and interesting.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
